# Installation 
1. Fork and clone down the repository.
2. Open the repository on the root level and run yarn. 
3. Run yarn start to view the repository at localhost:3000. 

**If you would like to generate your build artifacts, run 'yarn construct' rather than 'yarn build'. This command was changed to fix a bug encountered during Netlify deployment.
