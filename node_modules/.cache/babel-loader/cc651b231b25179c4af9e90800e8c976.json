artist and graphic designer from San Diego residing in Philadelphia. Angel is committed to actively engage in responsible collaborative environments, not just with the objective of accumulating community, but to purposefully (in togetherness) co-evolve horizontally and detoxify from depersonalized power structures.  They aspire to be surrounded by relative and diverse perspectives, carrying a potential manifestation of adjacent fluid practices co-creating towards collective experiences and empowerment for future generations. Identity welcoming itself through action, relation, experience and therefore love. “I dance with the person I am. I live with the wisdom dance lends.” Angel is fascinated by the expansive and transformational world of digital media and its possible ability to manifest anywhere. Whether it’s film work, photography or any digital media, the material interests are sourced in performance and dance, highlighting the magnetism of movement. They currently are the marketing director and one of the designers of NYC’s dance collective FAILSPACE NYC. Angel is one of four founding members of group project a film collective in Philadelphia. Recently Angel joined CHILD, a company of artists making shows using an experimental framework directed by Lisa Fagan.</p>\n                            </div>\n                            <div class=\"portrait\">\n                                <img class=\"SC-portrait\" src=\"/images/Portraits/angel 2.png\"/>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"flex SC-member mobile-column-reverse\">\n                            <div class=\"flex bio column\">\n                                <h3>Nora Alami</h3>\n                                <p>Nora Alami deconstructs and integrates historically disparate dance forms. Navigating the overlap between her Moroccan and American heritage, her work builds performative contexts that investigate the embodied experience of colonization and identity politics. In flux between fluidity, tension, awkwardness, and discomfort, Nora presents evocations that are dramaturgical, conceptual, and in ritual. Her tools: radical acts of permission-giving, intentional displacement of cultural vantage points, and multidisciplinarity braiding.</p>\n\n                                <p>Her choreography has been presented at the Center for Performance Research, New York Live Arts, International Center of Photography, pOnderosa, Colorado College, and Movement Research at Judson Church. She has performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, River to River Festival, and toured internationally at the 2018 Focus on Mediterranean Choreography platform in Castiglioncello and Spoleto, Italy.</p>\n\n                                <p>She has been awarded the Alliance for Artist Communities’ Diversity + Leadership Fellowship, New York Live Arts Fresh Tracks Choreographic Residency, and Miguel Gutierrez’s Landing 2.0. Currently, Nora collaborates as a creative producer for Jasmine Hearn Collaborates, a dramaturg for Medusa: A New Musical, on the Steering Committee for FAILSPACE, and as a creative consultant supporting the arts. Recently, Nora was a 2021 JACK Resident Artist, a 2021 BRIClab: Performing Arts Resident Artist, and a recipient of the 2021 Rest and Restore Residency at The Petronio Center. She is the 2022 Resident Artist at Triskelion Arts where she is building The Eros Project.
