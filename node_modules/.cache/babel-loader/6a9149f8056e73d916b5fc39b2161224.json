performance that nurtures creative exchange between three intergenerational partnerships. Our workshops will be co-taught by the following mentorship pairings: Juliana F. May and Lisa Fagan, Jonathan Gonzalez and Stacy Skolnik, and estrella/x supernova and mayfield brooks.</p>\n                    <p class=\"ivy-text\">FAILSPACE has been processing the multiple realites that appear when organizing artistic programming. We have learned that “programming” is and has always been relationship, and when treated as such has the capacity to hold us in place. We spent the last year and a half in slow relationship with the mentors and mentees, grounding in our collective needs and providing a reactive surface for research and conversation to inspire. We hope that the relationships we have cultivated with these incredible artists extend to and nourish our broader community.</p>\n                    <p class=\"ivy-text\">We are moving in unison with the moment of this time. We want nothing but to hold the evershifting nature of our movement to meet our evershifting collective needs. As we reenter and remember gathering, we recognize the immense amount of trust and vulnerability that these gatherings necessitate after...after..after... Will you hold our hands after all this time?</p>\n                    <p class=\"ivy-text\">During the COVID-19 Pandemic, FAILSPACE facilitated encounters between each of the postponed mentorship pairs to be in service of cultivating mentorship, research, and relationships. The souvenirs from each of their encounters are linked to their names to the left. These encounters and sourvenirs have shaped each of the workshops from their initially proposed forms to something that is reflective of the prolonged mentorship.</p>\n                    <p class=\"ivy-text\">We hope that these souvenirs act as reminders to our community that we create the conditions of our partnerships, both intimate and public.</p>\n                    <p class=\"ivy-text\">We also hope that the bring you joy.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"table-heading ivy-text\">\n                <h3>Lisa Fagan & Juliana F.

We will move and make after prolonged inactivity, pain, anxiety and loss, and in our gathering, we will welcome ungrounded, bizarre, and new feelings that arise. The workshop will hold space to include the individual ways we have been shaped during the pandemic in order to find our collective way through to embodying reimagined practices. This workshop meets people wherever they are and whomever they are becoming.</p> \n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"table-heading ivy-text\">\n                <h3>Stacy Skolnik & Jonathan Gonzalez</h3>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"flex column bg-ivy table-padding\">\n                <div>\n                <p className=\"zero-margin\"><b>Workshop Details</b></p>\n                    <h4>July 19-26, 2021\n                    <br></br>Prospect Park Peninsula</h4>\n\n                    <p className=\"zero-margin\"><b>Workshop Description</b></p>\n                    <h4>Co-authoring</h4>\n                    <p>This workshop invites participants of any medium and skill set to convene for improvisatory and discursive gatherings in an open-air setting. By way of establishing/editing/excising our vested creative interests and citational principles through processes of sharing aloud (as in a reading, a dance, a sound played over a speaker, a fleeting refrain), “co-authoring” will be a methodology we come to define collectively.</p>\n\n\n                    <h4>Notes</h4>\n                    <p>We will be meeting in a public park on grass so please bring anything you require to find comfort.
