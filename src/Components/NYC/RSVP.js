                            <p>This workshop will focus on deconstructing movement habits, working with efficiency while encountering complexity, and the building of mobility, endurance, and strength. We will work with improvisation, which has been developed focusing on impulses to simultaneously coordinate and disassociate the body. Continuity and the layering of focus are tools which we will use to identify habits and create new movement patterns. The form of exploration will develop in gradual layers and vary, offering the chance to explore the body through upright positions, through the floor, and through the air, always focusing on an active and inquisitive process. All movement backgrounds and levels are more than welcome.</p>
